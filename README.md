# DEVELOPMENT & VALIDATION OF BASIC SIMULATED ANNEALING ALGORITHM

The Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is an optimization technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy and is effective for solving complex problems. The algorithm was introduced in the combinatorial optimization area by (S. Kirkpatrick, C. D. Gelatt, Jr., M. P. Vecchi, 1983). The SA algorithm is designed around the Metropolis Criterion, which probabilistically accepts worse solutions based on the current temperature, facilitating the escape from local optima. The choices of the initial temperature, the number of iterations before reducing the temperature, and the temperature reduction factor play important roles in the successful convergence of the algorithm (Daniel Delahaye, Supatcha Chaimatanan, Marcel Mongeau, 2019).
The primary objective of this study is to develop and validate a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm capable of effectively solving complex optimization problems. This involves creating a robust SA algorithm with crucial components such as the Metropolis Criterion and different cooling schedules and evaluating its overall performance using unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions to assess its efficiency and effectiveness (Momin Jamil, Xin-She Yang, 2013).
In this study, the key parameters such as the cooling schedule and Markov chain length are systematically varied to analyze their influence on the algorithm’s effectiveness. Hence, the study compares constant versus dynamic Markov chain lengths to identify the most effective configurations. Moreover, two cooling schedules (linear and exponential) are explored to understand their impact on temperature reduction and convergence. This comprehensive framework thoroughly evaluates the SA algorithm’s capabilities and impact on the solution quality, providing insights into optimal parameter settings and practical applicability in solving diverse and challenging optimization problems.
The main results of this study demonstrate that the dynamically adjusted Markov chain length approach provides more efficient use of computational resources, reducing overall computational time while maintaining solution quality. Moreover, the linear cooling schedule performed better regarding expected error for unimodal and multimodal functions, though with a higher computational cost. This reflects the importance of selecting appropriate parameters to achieve a tradeoff between computational efficiency and the accuracy of the final solution in Simulated Annealing algorithms.
